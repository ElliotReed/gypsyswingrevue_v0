          <p>Gypsy Swing Revue is a group based in the Denver metro area of Colorado. They perform music in the "Hot Club" style popularized by Django Reinhardt and Stephane Grappelli in Paris during the 30's and 40's. The focus is on tight arrangements with plenty of room for jazz improvisation. With a mix of instrumental pieces and vocals, this energetic music is fun for everyone.

          <p>Django Reinhardt and Stephane Grappelli were working musicians in Paris in the mid 1930's. They were working as side men in Louis Vola's band, but between sets, they would jam on the new swing music coming over from America. Eventually settling on a format of two rhythm guitars, lead guitar, violin and upright bass, they created their own versions of the music that was becoming popular in the States, but had yet to make inroads in France and Europe in general.
